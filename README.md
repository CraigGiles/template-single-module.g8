# Scala Single Module Template
Base template for generic single-module scala application. This template holds
a placeholder "StackModule" which can be ran via `sbt run` or `sbt test`

## Installation
If you're using sbt 13.13, simply run the `sbt new` command with this github url.

```
sbt new craiggiles/template-single-module.g8
```

If you're using a version of sbt prior to 13.13 and do not wish to update then
you can install and use giter8.

```
g8 craiggiles/template-single-module.g8
```

## Contributing
